    description: `Fehling reagent comprises of two solutions, Fehling solution A and Fehling solution B. Fehling solution A is aqueous copper sulphate and Fehling solution B is alkaline sodium potassium tartarate (Rochelle salt). These two solutions are mixed in equal amounts before test. On heating an aldehyde with Fehling’s reagent, a reddish brown precipitate is obtained. Aldehydes are oxidised to corresponding carboxylate anion. Aromatic aldehydes do not respond to this test.<br><br><strong>Reactions of Fehling’s Test</strong><br><br>In Fehling’s solution the reaction between copper(II) ions and aldehyde is represented as:<br><br><strong>RCHO + 2 Cu2+ + 5 OH− → RCOO− + Cu2O + 3 H2O</strong>strong><br><br>When tartrate is added:<br><br><strong>RCHO + 2 Cu(C4H4O6)22− + 5 OH− → RCOO− + Cu2O + 4 C4H4O62− + 3 H2O</strong>`,
    
    application: `Some common uses of Fehling’s test are; it is used to determine whether a carbonyl group is an aldehyde or a ketone. Aldehydes tend to get oxidized and give positive result. Ketones apart from alpha-hydroxy-ketones do not react.<br><br>Fehling’s test is also used as a general test for monosaccharides where a positive result is obtained for aldose monosaccharides and ketose monosaccharides. Apart from these, Fehling’s test is used in the medical field to determine the presence of glucose in urine. It helps to know whether the person is diabetic or not.`,
    
    history: `The test was developed by <strong>German chemist Hermann von Fehling in 1849</strong>. On the left, the solution in the absence of reducing sugars. On the right, copper oxide, which would appear in the bottom of the solution if reducing sugars are present.`
