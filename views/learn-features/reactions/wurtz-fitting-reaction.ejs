    description: '<strong>What is the Wurtz-Fittig Reaction?</strong><br><br>The Wurtz-Fittig reaction mechanism can be explained either via the organo-alkali mechanism or the radical mechanism. The Wurtz-Fittig reaction is a chemical process that produces substituted aromatic compounds from aryl halides, alkyl halides, sodium metal, and dry ether.<br><br>In 1855, Charles Adolphe Wurtz first reported the process that is now known as the Wurtz reaction, which involves combining two alkyl halides to generate a new carbon-carbon bond. An example of such a reaction is shown below.<image style="max-width: 100%;" align="center" src="../../reaction-image/wf-1.png"></image>',
