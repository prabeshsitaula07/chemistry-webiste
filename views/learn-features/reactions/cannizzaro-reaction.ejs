    general_reaction: `<strong>Aldehydes which do not have an α-hydrogen atom, undergo self oxidation and reduction (disproportionation) reaction</strong> on treatment with <strong>concentrated alkali</strong>. In this reaction, one molecule of the aldehyde is <strong>reduced to alcohol</strong> while another is <strong>oxidised to carboxylic acid salt</strong>.`,

    description: `<h3>Mechanism of Cannizzaro Reaction</h3><br><strong>Mechanism Step 1</strong><br><br>A nucleophile such as a hydroxide ion is used to attack the carbonyl group of the given aldehyde, causing a disproportionation reaction and giving rise to an anion carrying 2 negative charges.<br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../reaction-image/cann-1.png"><br><br><strong>Mechanism Step 2</strong><br><br>This resulting intermediate can now function as a hydride reducing agent. Due to its unstable nature, the intermediate releases a hydride anion. This hydride anion proceeds to attack another aldehyde molecule. Now, the doubly charged anion is converted into a carboxylate anion and the aldehyde is converted into an alkoxide anion.<br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../reaction-image/cann-2.png"><br><br><h3>Crossed Cannizzaro Reaction</h3><br>Crossed Cannizzaro Reaction is the reaction that produces only 50% of the required alcohol and carboxylic acid under ideal conditions. This is why the crossed Cannizzaro reaction is more commonly used. A sacrificial aldehyde is combined with a more valuable chemical and formaldehyde is used as a reductant, oxidizing it to sodium formate. The required alcohol is obtained from the reduction of the other aldehyde chemical. Since 2 different aldehydes can be completely converted into the required product, the yield of the valuable chemical is increased.<br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../reaction-image/cann-3.png"><br><br>To conclude, the Cannizzaro reaction can be used to influence a disproportionation of a non-enolizable aldehyde. The cross Cannizzaro reaction is employed to increase the yield of the valuable chemical.`,

    application: `The Cannizzaro reaction can be utilized to influence a non-enolizable aldehyde disproportionation. In the industry, polyols are produced utilizing a combination of the crossed Cannizzaro reaction and aldol condensation. Polyols are highly valuable and used in a variety of industrial processes.`,
    
    history: `Early research. Cannizzaro's chemical interests centred on natural products and on reactions of aromatic compounds. In <strong>1853 he discovered that when benzaldehyde is treated with concentrated base, both benzoic acid and benzyl alcohol are produced—a phenomenon known today as the Cannizzaro reaction</strong>. Despite the fact that Cannizzaro struggled through much of his career with inadequate laboratory facilities, his published research was important and influential. In 1861 he returned to his native Palermo, where he taught for 10 years, making the local university the centre of chemical education and research in Italy. Among his students in Palermo was Wilhelm Körner, a German chemist who made his subsequent career in Italy and whose “absolute” method of determining the structure of aromatic derivatives solved a problem that had bedeviled organic chemists for many years. Cannizzaro’s last move, in 1871, was to the University of Rome, where he spent the rest of his long and distinguished career.`
