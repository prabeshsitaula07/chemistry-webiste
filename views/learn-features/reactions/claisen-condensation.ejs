    description: `<h3>What is Claisen Condensation?</h3><br>The Claisen condensation reaction is an organic coupling reaction that results in the formation of a C-C bond between either a single ester and one carbonyl compound or between two esters. The reaction proceeds when a strong base is present and the product of the reaction is a beta-keto ester or a beta-diketone.<br><br>The reaction is named after its discoverer, the German chemist Rainer Ludwig Claisen. An illustration of this reaction is provided below. The mechanism of the Claisen condensation reaction proceeds with the removal of an alpha proton through the action of a strong base to result in the formation of an enolate ion.<br><br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../reaction-image/claisen-condensation.jpg" alt=""><br><br>-The Claisen condensation reaction requires that a minimum of one reagent must have an alpha proton and can form an enolate anion upon deprotonation.<br>-The reaction also requires the base to avoid participating in nucleophilic substitution reactions or nucleophilic addition with a carbon belonging to the carbonyl functional group.<br>-An ideal base for this reaction is the sodium alkoxide which is the conjugate base of the alcohol to be formed since it is regenerated.<br>-Another requirement is that the alkoxy part of the ester must behave as a good leaving group, as in the case of ethyl and methyl esters.<br><br>
    It can be noted that when different esters undergo a Claisen condensation reaction, a mixture of four different products is obtained. The yield of the reaction can be improved with the usage of a very strong base, such as NaOH.<br><br><h3>Mechanism of Claisen Condensation</h3><br><strong>Step 1</strong><br><br>The strong base removes an alpha proton. This results in the generation of the enolate ion. This enolate anion is relatively stable due to the delocalization of the negative charge (electrons). Given below is the reaction which leads to the formation of the enolate anion.<br><br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../reaction-image/cla-1.png" alt=""><br><br><strong>Step 2</strong><br><br>The carbonyl carbon belonging to the second ester reactant is now the target of a nucleophilic attack from the enolate anion. This leads to the elimination of the alkoxy group and the regeneration of the conjugate base of the alcohol. This alkoxide ion removes the doubly alpha proton which is formed, giving rise to a new enolate anion which is now resonance stabilized. The formation of this new enolate ion is illustrated below.<br><br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../reaction-image/cla-2.png" alt=""><br><br><strong>Step 3</strong><br><br>Now, an aqueous acid (phosphoric acid or sulphuric acid, for example) is added to neutralize the negative charge on the enolate anion as well as any base which is still present. This leads to the formation of a beta-diketone or a beta-keto ester, which is immediately isolated. The leaving group is removed. The final step of the Claisen condensation mechanism can be illustrated as follows:<br><br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../reaction-image/cla-3.png" alt=""><br><br>Thus, the ester (or carbonyl compound and ester) reactants are converted into beta-keto esters or beta-diketones. The Claisen condensation reaction has been modified into several variations, which are discussed in the next subsection.`,
    
    application: `This is a reaction process that carries the conversion of an ester and an aldehyde or a ketone into a β-hydroxy ester or an α,β-unsaturated ester. The mechanism holds vital applications in the synthesis of larger organic compounds and a range of potentially biologically active compounds.`,
    
    history: `<strong>The Claisen condensation</strong> is a carbon–carbon bond forming reaction that occurs between two esters or one ester and another carbonyl compound in the presence of a strong base, resulting in a β-keto ester or a β-diketone. It is named after <strong>Rainer Ludwig Claisen</strong>, who first published his work on the reaction in <strong>1887</strong>.`
