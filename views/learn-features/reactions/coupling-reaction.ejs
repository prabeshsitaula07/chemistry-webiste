    description: `<h3>What is a Coupling Reaction?</h3><br>The term ‘coupling reaction’ refers to the class of organic reactions that involve the joining of two chemical species (usually with the help of a metal catalyst). An important type of coupling reaction is the reaction of an organic halide with an organometallic compound having the general formula R-M which facilitates the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. If the organic halide in this reaction has the general formula R’-X, the compound formed as a product will have the formula R-R’.<br><br>An illustration of a coupling reaction is provided below.<br><br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../reaction-image/cou-1.png" alt=""><br><br>Here, R1 and R3 denote alkyl, alkene, or alkyne groups and R2 denotes an H-group or an alkyl group. Note that X denotes a halide group.<br><br><h3>Types of Coupling Reactions</h3><br>Coupling reactions can be classified into two types based on the chemical species that are combined by them:<br><br><strong>Homo-coupling reactions</strong>: Here, two identical chemical species are combined to yield a single product.<br><strong>Hetero-coupling reactions (also known as cross-coupling reactions)</strong>: Here, two dissimilar chemical species are joined together to afford a single product.<br><br><strong>Examples of Homo-Coupling Reactions</strong><br><br>An important example of homo-coupling reactions is the Ullmann reaction, which is illustrated below.<br><br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../reaction-image/cou-2.png" alt=""><br><br><strong>Examples of Cross-Coupling Reactions</strong><br><br>The Heck reaction is an important example of a cross-coupling reaction. The Heck reaction of an aryl halide and an alkene is illustrated below.<br><br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../reaction-image/cou-3.png" alt="">`,
