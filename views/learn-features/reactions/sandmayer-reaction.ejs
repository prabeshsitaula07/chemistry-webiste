    description: `The Sandmeyer reaction is a type of substitution reaction that is widely used in the production of aryl halides from aryl diazonium salts. Copper salts like chloride, bromide or iodide ions are used as catalysts in this reaction. Notably, the Sandmeyer reaction can be used to perform unique transformations on benzene. The transformations include hydroxylation, trifluoromethylation, cyanation, and halogenation. \n
     The Sandmeyer reaction is believed to be a great example of a radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution. This reaction is a useful tool by which an amino group on an aromatic ring can be replaced with different substituents. During the Sandmeyer reaction, the amino group that is attached to an aromatic ring is converted into a diazonium salt that can be transformed into various functional groups.`,

    history: 'The reaction was first discovered in the year 1884, when Traugott Sandmeyer, a Swiss chemist, was conducting an experiment to synthesise phenylacetylene from benzene diazonium chloride and cuprous acetylide. However, at the end of the experiment, he obtained phenyl chloride as the main product.'
