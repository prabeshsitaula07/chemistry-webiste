    description: 'The Sandmeyer reaction is a type of substitution reaction that is widely used in the production of aryl halides from aryl diazonium salts. Copper salts like chloride, bromide or iodide ions are used as catalysts in this reaction. Notably, the Sandmeyer reaction can be used to perform unique transformations on benzene. The transformations include hydroxylation, trifluoromethylation, cyanation, and halogenation.',
