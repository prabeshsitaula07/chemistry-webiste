    description: `<h3>What is 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4 DNP Test)?</h3><br>
    Brady’s reagent (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine) is a red-orange solid, usually supplied wet to reduce the risk of explosion.<br><br><h3>2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine Structure</h3><br>The structure of 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine is given below.<br><img src="../../reaction-image/DNP-1.png"><br><br>2,4-DNP derivatives offer a convenient way of separating the components of a mixture of aldehydes and ketones. Rather than attempting to do this directly by fractional distillation, a chemist might take advantage first of the easy separation of 2,4-DNP derivatives by column chromatography. Since their formation from aldehydes and ketones is reversible, hydrolysis of the separated derivatives will then regenerate the original carbonyl compounds.<br><br><h3>Synthesis of 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine</h3><br>Although it’s not a familiarly substituted hydrazine, we can make a reasonable inference that hydrazine H2N-NH2 is a good nucleophile. So the synthesis of 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine can be done from the product, it is prepared by reacting hydrazine with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene. The electron-accepting effect of the two nitro groups makes this chloride easy to displace.<br><br><img src="../../reaction-image/DNP-2.png" alt=""><br>Since chlorine is ortho, para directing and deactivating, so we should nitrate chlorobenzene. Chlorobenzene is readily prepared from benzene itself, so the synthesis is complete and the reaction is given below.<br><img src="../../reaction-image/DNP-3.png" alt="">`,
    
    application: 'The 2,4-DNP test is a tried and true method for the presence of aldehyde and ketone functional groups in unknown organic compounds. When an aldehyde or a ketone is placed in a 2,4-DNP solution, a bright yellow-orange or red solid results, which constitutes a positive test.',
    
    history: `2,4-Dinitrophenol, commonly abbreviated as 2,4-DNP, is a chemical compound with a colorful and controversial history. Here is a brief overview:<br><br><strong>1. Discovery and Early Use (19th Century):</strong> 2,4-DNP was first synthesized in the late 19th century. Its vivid yellow color and its ability to undergo rapid oxidation reactions drew attention from chemists. In the early 20th century, it found use as a dye, wood preservative, and even as an insecticide.<br><br><strong>2. Medical Applications:</strong> In the 1930s, 2,4-DNP began to be explored for its potential medical applications. It was discovered that it could disrupt cellular respiration by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, essentially causing cells to burn more energy without producing ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency of cells. This property led to its experimental use as a weight-loss drug.<br><br><strong>3. Weight Loss Craze (1930s-1940s):</strong> 2,4-DNP gained notoriety as a "miracle" weight loss drug during the 1930s and 1940s. It was marketed under various names such as "Dinitro" and "Mitcal". Despite its potential to induce rapid weight loss, it came with severe and sometimes fatal side effects, including hyperthermia, tachycardia, sweating, and cataracts. Reports of deaths and serious illnesses associated with its use led to its banning for human consumption in many countries.<br><br><strong>4. Regulatory Response:</strong> Due to its dangers, many governments moved to regulate or ban the sale of 2,4-DNP for human consumption. In the United States, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 effectively prohibited its sale as a dietary supplement. However, due to its continued availability as a chemical reagent, cases of accidental or intentional poisoning continued to occur sporadically.<br><br>
    <strong>5. Industrial and Research Uses:</strong> Despite its risks, 2,4-DNP continued to find applications in various industries and research fields. It is used in laboratories as a reagent for the detection of carbonyl compounds. In industry, it has been employed in the manufacture of dyes, explosives, and as a pesticide. However, its use is tightly regulated due to its toxicity.<br><br><strong>6. Contemporary Concerns:</strong> While its use as a weight loss aid has largely been discontinued, 2,4-DNP remains a subject of concern due to its potential for misuse and toxicity. There have been instances of individuals attempting to use it for weight loss, often resulting in severe illness or death. Its status as a chemical of interest for law enforcement agencies also remains due to its potential misuse in the production of explosives or illicit drugs.<br><br>In summary, 2,4-DNP has a complex history, transitioning from a chemical curiosity to a notorious weight loss aid and ultimately becoming tightly regulated due to its severe toxicity.`
