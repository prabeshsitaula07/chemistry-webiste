    description: `An aqueous solution of 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine (DNP) is known as Brady's reagent. It reacts with carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketone) to give a coloured precipitate. These precipitates have a sharp melting point. The melting points of the precipitates confirm the carbonyl compounds.`,
